Empowering People of African Descent: Hate Speech, Violence and Racism- Training on Digital Skills and Civic Participation

I conducted a comprehensive sentiment analysis of online press and social media content across Greece, Italy, and Spain. The initial phase involved scraping online press articles to extract their text and titles, complemented by acquiring tweets labeled for hate speech from the TweetEval dataset available on Hugging Face. For sentiment evaluation, we employed VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a lexicon and rule-based tool that assigns a compound sentiment score alongside specific scores for positive and negative sentiments. To enhance our analysis, we integrated API calls to ChatGPT 4.0-mini, utilizing a meticulously crafted prompt refined through extensive experimentation. This approach enabled us to classify texts for the presence of racial hate speech targeting Black individuals and to assess whether the author's intent was racially motivated. Our goal was to construct a dataset encompassing columns for text, title, newspaper, sentiment, hate speech, hate speech explanation, author's motivation, and an explanation of the author's motivation. Leveraging large language models like ChatGPT facilitated the generation of detailed explanations for hate speech and the author's intent, thereby enriching the dataset with nuanced insights.

Sentiment Analysis code:

- Vader_Sentiment.py

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): uses a lexicon and rule-based approach to evaluate the sentiment of text data. 
It's particularly well-suited for analyzing social media, news articles, and other forms of online text.

KEY FEATURES:
    Pre-Trained Sentiment Lexicon:
    VADER relies on a lexicon (a dictionary) of words that have been scored for their sentiment intensity (Positive words like "great," "awesome," or "fantastic" have high positive scores).
    Handles Sentiment Modifiers:
    VADER accounts for intensifiers, negations, and other modifiers that influence sentiment (Intensifiers: Words like "very" or "extremely" increase sentiment intensity). 
    Works Well for Short Text
    Emoticons, Slang, and Punctuation
    VADER recognizes emojis, internet slang, and punctuation to capture a better sentiment in informal text ("I love it!! ðŸ˜Š" will have a stronger positive sentiment due to the exclamation points and smiley face).
    Scores for Sentiment Polarity:
    VADER provides a compound sentiment score and scores for each sentiment category:
        Positive Score: Measures the intensity of positive sentiment.
        Negative Score: Measures the intensity of negative sentiment.
        Neutral Score: Measures the intensity of neutral sentiment.
        Compound Score: A normalized score between -1 (most negative) and +1 (most positive). It reflects the overall sentiment of the text.
